An 18 is always a critical failure.  
A 17 is a critical failure if the target is 15 or less. Otherwise it's a simple failure.  
Any miss by 10 or more is a critical failure.  
A 3 and 4 are always critical successes.  
A 5 is a critical success if your target was 15.  
A 6 is a critical success if your target was 16 or more.
