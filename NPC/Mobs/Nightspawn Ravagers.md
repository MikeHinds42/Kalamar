Nightspawn Ravagers

The creatures that attacked Kaeden are known as Nightspawn Ravagers. These vicious, twisted beings are summoned from dark realms by powerful curses or necromantic magic, often appearing where dark spells have scarred the land.

Nightspawn Ravagers are shadowy, skeletal creatures with elongated limbs and razor-sharp claws that can tear through armor. They have an insatiable hunger for vitality, feeding off the life force of their victims. These monsters are particularly drawn to those who radiate holy or healing energy, as if compelled to snuff out such light wherever they find it.

Description:  
Nightspawn Ravagers are skeletal, shadow-infused creatures with gangly limbs and claws as sharp as razors. Their gaunt, hollow forms are wreathed in a faint, shadowy aura, and they exude an unnatural chill. Drawn to sources of life and light, they hunger for the vitality of living beings, often appearing to attack those who wield holy magic or powerful healing abilities. Nightspawn Ravagers are difficult to kill by physical means alone, as they partially exist within the plane of shadows.

### Special Abilities

- Shadow Phase: The Nightspawn Ravager can partially shift into the plane of shadows, reducing all incoming physical damage by half. This ability is suppressed by holy or light-based magic.
    
- Fear Aura: Any creature attempting to come within 2 yards of a Ravager must make a successful Will roll; failure means they are overcome with fear and cannot approach.
    
- Shadow Leap: Once every 5 seconds, the Ravager can teleport up to 10 yards to any shadowed area within line of sight.
