### **Moonshade Lurker**

**Description:**  
A **Moonshade Lurker** is a shadowy predator infused with residual lunar magic, created during the Fae invasion to guard abandoned elven sites. It appears as a dark, semi-transparent silhouette with faintly glowing eyes, barely distinguishable from the surrounding shadows under moonlight. Silent and elusive, it strikes with unnatural precision and vanishes into the darkness before retaliation.

### **Behavior**

- **Tactics:** The Moonshade Lurker stalks prey from the shadows, striking swiftly and retreating to the darkness. It focuses on isolating and terrorizing weaker targets before attacking the rest of the group.
- **Weakness:** Intense light (like sunlight or magical sources) temporarily disrupts its abilities, reducing its Stealth and making it vulnerable.
