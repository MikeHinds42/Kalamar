   
   The four human mages who lead the magical group to construct the barrier to hold back the fae invation some 800 years ago. call Nedan, Barak, Harac and Synon.

Over time they where all  corupted and drawn to necromacy.

in recent years 

   Dead - Nedan the Black - ruled the city of the undead   - Leader of "The Pale Host" an undead army  . replaced with an undead dragon. follower of the coruptor
   

   Barak -  was North/West coast (in Volderwoods )- killed by adventures. follower of the corruptor

   Harac - somewhere in the heart of the empire. “The Puppeteer”

   Synon - believed by many to have been killed by the Elves. claimed to own the North East Lands,
   currently helped by the Elves in the west . being helped with his return from evil to the light 

so it appears Synon had a strong hold in in the Eastern elven lands. some tower or structure which he was able to access after the barrier was formed. He is now held by the Elves and so unable to protect his home. what my be there to interest the magic users, his original magical powers and may be info on his fall to necromancy. and info on how the necromantic gates are formed unlike other portals .
