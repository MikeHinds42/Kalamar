### The Search for a Paladin Chapter House: The Stronghold at Yatar

Kaeden’s research in the library uncovers the history of Yatar, a bustling trade town located at the crossroads of two major trade routes. Overlooking the town was **Crossroad Keep**, a fortified stronghold that controlled the flow of goods and provided protection to the surrounding region. Built with Elven precision and Dwarven durability, the keep was a marvel of military architecture, featuring high walls, a central watchtower, and barracks large enough to house a standing force.

The town and keep were abandoned when the Fae invaded decades ago, transforming the once-thriving roads into shimmering paths of disorientation and trapping the area in a strange, dreamlike state. With the Fae now mysteriously vanished, Yatar and its keep have been left untouched, with only echoes of their magical invasion lingering. Crossroad Keep remains structurally sound and could be reclaimed with minimal effort, making it an ideal location for a new chapter house. Its position at the heart of old trade routes would allow the paladins to establish a commanding presence, facilitating their mission of safeguarding travellers and spreading their influence.
### Who Else May Have Their Eye on Crossroad Keep
- **Merchant Guilds:** The old trade routes connecting Yatar remain valuable. Several guilds may seek to claim Crossroad Keep to re-establish their caravans and use the stronghold as a base for tolls and storage.
- **Bandits or Mercenaries:** Opportunists see the keep’s strategic position as a chance to control the surrounding region. A bandit leader or mercenary captain might already be eyeing the keep as a potential fortress.
- **A Rogue Fae Lord:** Though the Fae have vanished, rumors persist of a lone Fae lord who still lingers in the area, viewing Crossroad Keep as a connection to their lost realm. Reclaiming the stronghold might provoke their ire.
- **Cultists:** Drawn by lingering traces of Fae magic, a small cult may believe Crossroad Keep holds secrets or power they can exploit, especially if they think it connects to the Fae realm.
- **Rival Orders:** Another knightly order or religious faction might seek to claim the keep for themselves, either to establish their presence in the region or to counter the influence of the paladins.
Securing Crossroad Keep will require Kaeden to act swiftly and decisively, navigating both the practical challenges of restoration and the potential rivalries of those who might wish to take the stronghold for their own purposes. If successful, the keep could serve as a symbol of the paladins’ resurgence and a bastion of hope at the crossroads of the realm.
