Kaeden recognizes that reclaiming any of these forges would be a monumental task but could provide the paladins with armaments of unparalleled quality. However, each location presents unique challenges, including environmental hazards, magical guardians, and competing interests from other factions or creatures who have claimed the ruins for their own purposes.
