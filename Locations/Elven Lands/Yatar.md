### Yatar

The history of Yatar, a bustling trade town located at the crossroads of two major trade routes. Overlooking the town was **Crossroad Keep**, a fortified stronghold that controlled the flow of goods and provided protection to the surrounding region. Built with Elven precision and Dwarven durability, the keep was a marvel of military architecture, featuring high walls, a central watchtower, and barracks large enough to house a standing force.

The town and keep were abandoned when the Fae invaded decades ago, transforming the once-thriving roads into shimmering paths of disorientation and trapping the area in a strange, dreamlike state. With the Fae now mysteriously vanished, Yatar and its keep have been left untouched, with only echoes of their magical invasion lingering. Crossroad Keep remains structurally sound and could be reclaimed with minimal effort, making it an ideal location for a new chapter house. Its position at the heart of old trade routes would allow the paladins to establish a commanding presence, facilitating their mission of safeguarding travellers and spreading their influence.
