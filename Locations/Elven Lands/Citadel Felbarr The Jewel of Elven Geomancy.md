### Citadel Felbarr: The Jewel of Elven Geomancy

**At the Height of the Elven Nation:**  
Citadel Felbarr was once the pinnacle of Elven geomantic research and healing magic. Situated atop a confluence of powerful ley lines, the citadel gleamed with ethereal light, its spires formed from crystalline structures that resonated with the natural flows of magical energy. The site housed the **Verdant Cartographers**, a revered order of Elven scholars and mages devoted to detecting and mapping ley lines. They compiled detailed atlases known as the _Glyphic Tomes of Felbarr_, which guided healers and geomancers across the Elven nation. Surrounding the citadel, gardens bloomed year-round with rare medicinal plants nurtured by the ley line energies, while fountains of liquid mana provided unparalleled resources for magical study. Thousands of pilgrims visited each year, seeking blessings, healing, or insights into their spiritual connection with the world.

**The State of Felbarr Today:**  
The citadel now lies in ruins, its once-lustrous spires shattered and overgrown with wild vegetation. The ley lines beneath it still hum with power, causing sporadic bursts of magical phenomena, such as floating stones, glowing moss, and the occasional manifestation of spectral echoes from its glorious past. Scattered remnants of the Glyphic Tomes may remain, hidden in crumbled archives or sealed chambers, though much of the knowledge has been lost or fragmented. The site exudes a melancholic beauty, drawing adventurers, scholars, and treasure hunters seeking its secrets or hoping to harness the raw magic of its ley lines.

**Enemies Attracted to Felbarr:**  
The latent energy of Citadel Felbarr has become a beacon for various threats. **Mana Wraiths**, incorporeal entities drawn to the ley lines, haunt the ruins, attacking any who seek to tap the site's power. Bands of opportunistic **orc shamans** have attempted to harness the ley lines to empower destructive rituals, using blood sacrifices to forcefully channel the energy. Fae creatures, such as **Spriggans** and **Will-oâ€™-Wisps**, now roam the site, claiming it as their domain and leading intruders into traps. Finally, a **cult of necromancers**, believing the ley lines can amplify their dark magic, has taken a sinister interest in Felbarr, threatening to desecrate the sacred grounds with their experiments.
